This is a project to build a small lang with an interpreter. 

Inspired by ThePrimeagen's streams where he builds an interpreter in different languages
[Check his repo](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/ts-rust-zig-deez/)

Also inspired by [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) and of course the book that ThePrimeagen is recommending in this streams
[Writting An interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)

While I use this sources, I am making an effort on coming up with solutions myself, so, yes, mistakes were made
