This is a project to build a small lang with an interpreter. 

Inspired by ThePrimeagen's streams where he builds an interpreter in different languages [(check his repo)](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/ts-rust-zig-deez/)

JavaScript was my first language, then I learned some Java and later on some Rust and when I had to go back to JS I felt like I didn't understand at all what was happening (and absolutely hated it).
I hope this project can help me understand how languages in general work, and in particular, how interpreted languages work.

I would also love trying to write a simple compiler at some point, but I don't know enough asm (almost nothing, in fact) yet.

Also inspired by [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) and of course the book that ThePrimeagen is recommending in this streams [Writting An interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).

While I use this sources as a guide, I am making an effort on coming up with solutions myself, so, yes, mistakes were made. When I get something working I will try to optimize it and make it better.
Maybe I will also try to implement this on Rust when I finish it on Java.
